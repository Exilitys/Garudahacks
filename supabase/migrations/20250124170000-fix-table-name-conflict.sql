-- Fix table name conflict and RLS issues for speaker invitations
-- The error mentions "event_invitations" but we're using "speaker_invitations"
-- This suggests there might be a naming conflict or wrong table reference

-- First, let's check if there's an existing event_invitations table and rename it if needed
-- If event_invitations table exists, it might be conflicting
DO $$
BEGIN
    -- Check if event_invitations table exists
    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'event_invitations') THEN
        -- If it exists and is empty or can be safely renamed
        ALTER TABLE event_invitations RENAME TO event_invitations_old;
        RAISE NOTICE 'Renamed existing event_invitations table to event_invitations_old';
    END IF;

        RAISE NOTICE 'No event_invitations table found or could not rename: %', SQLERRM;
