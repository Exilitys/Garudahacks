# Event Completion and Rating System Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds comprehensive event completion functionality, speaker rating system, and payment release management to the platform. The system allows both organizers and speakers to mark events as completed, enables organizers to rate speakers, and tracks speaker statistics.

## Database Changes

### 1. Status Constraint Fix (`20250125130000-fix-booking-status-constraint.sql`)

- **Purpose**: Fixes the booking status constraint to include 'paid' status
- **Changes**: Updates the `bookings_status_check` constraint to allow transition to 'paid' status
- **Impact**: Resolves the payment system error where bookings couldn't be marked as 'paid'

### 2. Event Completion System (`20250125140000-add-event-completion-and-ratings.sql`)

- **New Columns in `bookings` table**:

  - `completed_by_organizer`: Boolean tracking organizer completion confirmation
  - `completed_by_speaker`: Boolean tracking speaker completion confirmation
  - `completed_at`: Timestamp when both parties confirmed completion
  - `payment_released`: Boolean tracking if payment was released to speaker
  - `payment_released_at`: Timestamp of payment release
  - `organizer_rating`: Integer rating (1-5) given by organizer to speaker
  - `organizer_feedback`: Text feedback from organizer
  - `rated_at`: Timestamp when rating was submitted

- **New Columns in `speakers` table**:

  - `total_events_completed`: Counter of completed events
  - `total_earnings`: Total earnings in cents from completed events
  - `average_rating`: Calculated average rating from all reviews
  - `total_ratings`: Count of ratings received

- **New Functions**:

  - `mark_event_completed_by_organizer()`: Allows organizers to mark events complete
  - `mark_event_completed_by_speaker()`: Allows speakers to mark events complete
  - `rate_speaker()`: Allows organizers to rate speakers after completion
  - `check_event_completion()`: Trigger function that handles completion logic
  - `update_speaker_stats()`: Trigger function that updates speaker statistics

- **New Views**:
  - `speaker_dashboard_stats`: Comprehensive view of speaker statistics
  - `organizer_event_management`: View for organizer event management

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Event Completion Page (`EventCompletion.tsx`)

- **Route**: `/event-completion/:bookingId`
- **Features**:
  - Displays event details and payment information
  - Shows completion status for both organizer and speaker
  - Allows eligible users to mark events as completed
  - Provides rating interface for organizers
  - Validates event timing (only available 2 hours after event ends)
  - Permission-based access control

### 2. Updated MyEvents Page

- **New Features**:
  - "Complete Event" button for paid events that have passed
  - Direct navigation to event completion page
  - Visual indicators for completion status

### 3. Updated SpeakerEvents Page

- **New Features**:
  - "Complete Event" button for speakers on paid events
  - Completion status tracking
  - Navigation to completion interface

### 4. Speaker Dashboard (`SpeakerDashboard.tsx`)

- **Route**: `/speaker-dashboard`
- **Features**:
  - Total events completed counter
  - Total earnings display
  - Average rating with star visualization
  - Event status overview (pending, upcoming, paid, completed)
  - Payment tracking and statistics
  - Performance insights and career highlights

## Key Features

### Event Completion Workflow

1. **Prerequisites**: Event must be in 'paid' status and have concluded (2-hour buffer)
2. **Dual Confirmation**: Both organizer and speaker must confirm completion
3. **Automatic Processing**: When both confirm, booking status changes to 'completed'
4. **Payment Release**: Payment is automatically released to speaker upon completion
5. **Statistics Update**: Speaker stats are automatically updated

### Rating System

1. **Access Control**: Only organizers can rate speakers
2. **Timing**: Ratings only available after event completion
3. **Scale**: 1-5 star rating system with optional text feedback
4. **Statistics**: Automatically updates speaker's average rating and total ratings count

### Payment Release

1. **Automatic**: Triggered when both parties mark event complete
2. **Tracking**: Full audit trail of payment release timing
3. **Security**: Built-in validation and permission checks

### Speaker Statistics

1. **Real-time Updates**: Automatically maintained via database triggers
2. **Comprehensive Metrics**: Events, earnings, ratings, completion rates
3. **Dashboard Visualization**: Clear, actionable insights for speakers

## Security & Validation

### Database Level

- **RLS Policies**: Row-level security for all payment and completion data
- **Permission Checks**: Functions validate user authorization before actions
- **Data Integrity**: Check constraints ensure valid ratings and status transitions
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of all completion and rating activities

### Application Level

- **Route Protection**: Authentication required for all completion features
- **Permission Validation**: Frontend checks user roles before displaying actions
- **Input Validation**: Form validation for ratings and feedback
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and graceful fallbacks

## Migration Deployment

### Required Order

1. **First**: Apply `20250125130000-fix-booking-status-constraint.sql`
2. **Second**: Apply `20250125140000-add-event-completion-and-ratings.sql`

### Deployment Commands

```sql
-- Apply in sequence
\i supabase/migrations/20250125130000-fix-booking-status-constraint.sql
\i supabase/migrations/20250125140000-add-event-completion-and-ratings.sql
```

## Usage Workflow

### For Organizers

1. **After Event**: Navigate to MyEvents and click "Complete Event" button
2. **Confirm Completion**: Mark event as completed from organizer perspective
3. **Wait for Speaker**: Speaker must also confirm completion
4. **Rate Speaker**: Once both confirmed, submit rating and feedback
5. **Payment Release**: Payment automatically released to speaker

### For Speakers

1. **After Event**: Go to SpeakerEvents and click "Complete Event" button
2. **Confirm Completion**: Mark event as completed from speaker perspective
3. **Wait for Organizer**: Organizer must also confirm completion
4. **Receive Payment**: Payment automatically released upon mutual completion
5. **View Stats**: Check updated statistics on Speaker Dashboard

## Technical Notes

### Current Limitations (Pre-Migration)

- Event completion temporarily updates status directly to 'completed'
- Rating system stores feedback in `reviewer_notes` field temporarily
- Advanced statistics not available until migrations are applied

### Post-Migration Capabilities

- Full dual-confirmation completion workflow
- Comprehensive rating system with statistics
- Automatic payment release
- Real-time speaker statistics and dashboard
- Advanced reporting and analytics

## Testing Considerations

### Test Scenarios

1. **Completion Workflow**: Test both organizer and speaker completion paths
2. **Timing Validation**: Verify 2-hour buffer enforcement
3. **Permission Checks**: Test unauthorized access attempts
4. **Rating System**: Validate rating range and feedback storage
5. **Statistics Updates**: Verify automatic statistics calculations
6. **Payment Release**: Test payment release triggering and tracking

### Edge Cases

- Events without payment
- Incomplete confirmation (only one party confirms)
- Multiple completion attempts
- Invalid rating values
- Network failures during completion

This implementation provides a robust, secure, and user-friendly system for managing event completion, speaker ratings, and payment release while maintaining data integrity and providing valuable analytics for speakers.
